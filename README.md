# Rocket-2D-After-FIR

This was one of the projects I made over the first Covid lockdown, when I was 16. I made it using Pygame and assets I created myself using microsoft paint. It is exclusively coded in python.

This project pits neural net driven rockets to land on a platform, it was inspired by the accomplishments of SpaceX. Mechanics are implemented using SUVAT arithmetic. Rockets can run out of fuel and if they hit the ground too hard then they will be destroyed. Rockets can rotate and activate their engines to provide thrust. Following generation is cloned from the best performer from the previous generation. Performance is assessed by the agents speed when they make contact with the ground and the horizontal distance from the platform.

This was another attempt at the rocket problem I undertook before, however with everything I learnt from projects up to and including FIR. I also changed the setting a bit so that the rockets were landing on a smaller platform, and that the rockets start on the screen. So the challenge for the rockets is slightly different and there's more emphasis on slow control, rather than making the large distance to the platform.

Agents can be eliminated manually by clicking their portrait on the right handside, and agents can be hidden by inputting a number into the 'HIDE' button in the top right.
