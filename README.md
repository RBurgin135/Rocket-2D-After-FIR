# Rocket-2D-After-FIR

This was one of the projects I made over the first Covid lockdown, when I was 16. I made it using Pygame and assets I created myself using microsoft paint. It is exclusively coded in python.

This was another attempt at the rocket problem I undertook before, however with everything I learnt from projects up to and including FIR. I also changed the setting a bit so that the rockets were landing on a smaller platform, and that the rockets start on the screen. So the challenge for the rockets is slightly different and there's more emphasis on slow control, rather than making the large distance to the platform.
